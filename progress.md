# Project Progress and Features

## Initial Analysis
- Identified project as a full-stack application named `ChatHive`.
- Frontend: Next.js, located in `app/` and `components/`.
- Backend: Node.js/TypeScript, located in `server/`, using TypeORM.
- Containerization: Docker with `docker-compose`.

## Bug Fixes and Improvements

### 1. Message Sending Functionality
- **Problem:** Messages were not being sent correctly.
- **Solution:**
    - Modified the `Message` entity (`server/entities/Message.ts`) to correctly define the `receiver` relationship using `ManyToOne`.
    - Modified the `User` entity (`server/entities/User.ts`) to define the `receivedMessages` relationship using `OneToMany`.
    - Updated the `setupSocket` function in `server/socket/chat.ts` to fetch the `User` object for the receiver and associate it with the message, rather than just using the `receiverId`.

### 2. Docker Compose Warning
- **Problem:** `docker-compose.yml` showed a warning about an obsolete `version` attribute.
- **Solution:** Removed the `version: '3.8'` line from `docker-compose.yml`.

## Recent Bug Fixes and Improvements (June 2025)

---

âœ… **1. TypeScript Toast Component Issues**
- **Problem:** Type conflicts in toast components causing compilation errors
- **Fix:**
  - Fixed `ToastProps` interface to use proper types (`string` instead of `ReactNode` for title/description)
  - Added proper `ToastActionElement` type definition
  - Resolved export conflicts and circular dependencies
  - Updated both `use-toast.ts` files to use consistent types

âœ… **2. TypeORM EntityRepository Deprecation**
- **Problem:** Using deprecated `@EntityRepository` decorator
- **Fix:** Updated `typeorm.config.ts` with deprecation notice and guidance to use `AppDataSource.getRepository()` directly

âœ… **3. JWT Secret Inconsistency**
- **Problem:** Hardcoded JWT secrets that didn't match environment variables
- **Fix:** Updated `auth.ts` to consistently use `process.env.JWT_SECRET` with fallback

âœ… **4. ESLint Configuration Issues**
- **Problem:** Missing dependencies and incompatible config causing lint failures
- **Fix:**
  - Simplified ESLint config to use Next.js presets
  - Installed missing dependencies (`eslint-config-next`)
  - Removed problematic rules and fixed configuration conflicts

âœ… **5. Database Configuration Enhancement**
- **Problem:** Basic database config without environment-specific settings
- **Fix:** Enhanced `database.ts` with:
  - Support for multiple environment variable formats
  - Production-safe SSL configuration
  - Environment-specific logging and synchronization settings

âœ… **6. Next.js Configuration Fix**
- **Problem:** Static export mode that could cause issues in development
- **Fix:** Removed `output: 'export'` from `next.config.js` for better development experience

âœ… **7. Health Check Endpoint**
- **Added:** Health check route (`/api/health`) for Docker container monitoring

âœ… **8. Code Quality Improvements**
- All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- ESLint now runs without errors
- Better type safety throughout the application
- Consistent environment variable usage

---

ðŸ§ª **Verification**
- âœ… TypeScript compilation: `npx tsc --noEmit` â€” No errors
- âœ… Server TypeScript: No compilation errors
- âœ… ESLint: No warnings or errors
- âœ… All components properly typed

## Suggestions for Code Quality and Maintainability
- Centralized Error Handling for backend API routes.
- Robust Input Validation for all incoming data.
- Enhanced Authentication and Authorization checks.
- Improved Environment Variable Management.
- Comprehensive Logging using dedicated libraries.
- Careful consideration of TypeORM Relations and Eager/Lazy Loading.
- Continued enforcement of Code Consistency and Linting.
- Expansion of the Test Suite.
